## Introduction

The `main.py` file in this repository serves as the entry point for running the donut animation. Upon running `main.py`, the user is prompted to input the values of `x` and `y`, based on which different Python files are run to generate the desired donut animation.

## Usage

To run the donut animation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the repository.
3. Run the `main.py` file using Python:

        python main.py

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the values of `x` and `y`.
5. Enjoy the rotating ASCII art donut animation!

## Files

- `main.py`: Entry point for running the donut animation. Prompts the user to input `x` and `y` values and runs the appropriate Python files based on the input.
- `donut_normal.py`: Python script containing the code for generating the ASCII art representation of the rotating donut.
- Other Python files: Additional Python scripts that are run based on user input.
